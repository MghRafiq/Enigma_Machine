## We have built two versions

### **1 Colab Notebook (Browser)**

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YsfLa3pQiz-CxRuEcFZ79NCA28uyEHvd?usp=sharing

- **No installation required**
- Configure rotors, positions, rings, plugboard
- Encrypt/decrypt messages instantly
- Perfect for quick testing the key set up and the cipher function

### **2️ Desktop Simulator (Visual)**
- it requires a git clone, and getting inside the project's repository in your terminal
- pip install pygame
- python main.py
- First : you will need to set up the key in the terminal by following the instructions
- After the key configuration, you will have a Pop-up screen where you can type your messages and see the function and the encyphered text in real-time


## Technologies

- **Python 3** - Programming Language
- **Pygame** - Python library for visual simulators (desktop version)
- **Jupyter** - Interactive notebook (Colab)
